With the second wave of coronavirus in India and sudden spike in daily infections, the demand for remdesivir injections, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and plasma donors has increased massively once again. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug used in the treatment of COVID-19, is manufactured by a handful of companies under brand names like Cipremi (Cipla), Covifar (Hetero), Desrem (Mylon), Remdac (Zydus), Redyx (Dr. Reddy’s).

On Friday, State and the Central government said is taking all steps to accelerate the production of remdesivir injections and ensure its availability in the country.

It is being reported recently that remdesivir injections are being sold on the black market due to the high demand. Enforcement authorities of states and central government have been directed by Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to take immediate action on incidence of black-marketing, hoarding and overcharging of remdesivir.

Just like last year, several states which have been badly hit due to the pandemic are reporting a shortage of beds for COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, the state governments have also amped up its hospital bed capacity by declaring specific big hospitals as dedicated COVID centres, adding more beds and by opening makeshift COVID facilities.
To help people who are finding it difficult to get a hospital bed or any other COVID-19 patient facing a difficulty, social media platforms are being flooded with information about resources.
